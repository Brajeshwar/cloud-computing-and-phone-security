1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Do you or anyone in India know ... 

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:06,001
In America, in all meetings of the board of directors

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,000
In any kind of room

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The room is locked for one hour after the meeting.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:10,500
You didn't know that! Do you?

6
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:11,500
That Room!

7
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Manish: "Why?"

8
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:13,000
Because â€¦

9
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,000
In American, they have the technology,

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
where anyone with their special machine can

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
go to that room, within an hour, after the meeting

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and sniff out the audio from the air.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It takes exactly an hour for the audio to totally disappear.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let me educate you on another thing.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
As to today, there are instructions in America,

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
whenever an executive's done with his or her phone,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
they cannot sell to the junk-yard dealer.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Do you know how much these phones sell for?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's happening is

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You got the SIM card out but

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
that SIM card removal won't solve your problem.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
See, the data from the SIM Card goes to the battery.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The data from the SIM card got transferred to the battery.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Manish: "it goes to the battery!"

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The data is 'transmit'-ted

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You better try to understand this "process", it's a craze there.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In America, there are lots of shops

28
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
just to buy those used phone.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The only question asked is, "Whose phone was this?" See!

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Manish: "Who's was that!"

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In America, strict instructions are given

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
to destroy a used phone with a sledge hammer once they're done with.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Many companies had to incur millions of dollar just because

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
they didn't destroy their phone.

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
See! Nobody knew at the beginning! Poor fellow!

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You feel that all your data is in that small SIM Card.

37
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Don't be fooled!

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
See, if a SIM Card is in contact with the battery for enough time

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,500
all data get transferred, including 'secret' phone numbers.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
As I told you, we now live in a world where there are such Technology are commonplace.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,500
And 'one more thing'.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
These days, the whole 'technological system' comes from the 'Cloud CD'

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Do you realize that there is 'no need for no software no more'.

44
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,000
For instance, if you use Google

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
all your documents gets recorded in your computer.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Manish: "It gets installed on the computer!"

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
All the softwares of Google!

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Have you ever seen any 'Software CD' from Google?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, right!

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You'll never see their software in the CD-Stand!

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's all in the 'Cloud', the 'Cloud CD'.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We're now in a new generation, wherein besides connecting to the cloud,

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
You can get all the softwares and documents from the 'cloud'.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Till date, no study is conclusive, "Manish Ji"

55
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
If during the monsoon or in a storm.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can there be 'aberration' in the data?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Assume, in case of an 'aberration'.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Look at the case of the "Unique ID" for Indians.

59
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
What happens to a poor fellow ...

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Whose data was collected in the normal weather.

61
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,500
The Unique Identity will have to be in the forest.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Where the weather is clear to upload data to the 'cloud'.

63
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,500
We've to go deep miles and miles into the forest!

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The 'cloud' was good at that time.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
That gets uploaded to a particular 'Cloud CD.'

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That creates a 'Cloud Scene."

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
That's at a good state of the Cloud with the data.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Manish: "Ji" (read "Yes")

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, when you check back later on.

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,000
What if it's raining at that time, the weather is bad.

71
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Obviously, the data will be faulty, even corrupted.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The poor fellow is arrested, because of the wrong data.

73
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Assume if such error is just at 3% when the arrest started.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Or at 2%, even 1% with the Indian population is humongous.

75
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
The victim is already arrested, jailed ...

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, what would be the 'efficacy'?

77
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,000
This is such an unfortunate event with our country.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When a developed country like Britain

79
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
after 8 years of un-satisfied research, abandoned the idea.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They had rejected this very proposition.

81
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
"We're not yet 'technologically' 'proved' to pursue further."

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In a rare case of "aggress" possibility of

83
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,500
point zero zero zero zero zero ONE

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'd instantly buy that system!

85
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Because there are no system with 100% accuracy.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Manish: "But this changes ... the whole game ..."

87
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Even in a 1% possibility, or a 2%

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well then either the 2% is arrested or just the 2% is the right data.

89
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
That defeats the Purpose!

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
